# Design System: New Task Modal (RemindMee)
**Project ID:** 13692678390764865519

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
Calm, premium dark-mode UI with a focused, full-screen presentation. The vibe is quiet and modern: deep navy backgrounds, crisp electric-blue actions, and soft slate neutrals. The layout feels confident and uncluttered, with centered branding at the top and generous vertical spacing that keeps the forms breathable.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles
- **Crisp Electric Blue (#258cf4):** Primary action color for CTAs, links, and focus rings.
- **Deep Night Navy (#101922):** Primary dark background for the full-screen auth canvas.
- **Charcoal Slate (#1e293b):** Elevated surfaces and subtle container fills.
- **Steel Slate (#334155):** Secondary text and iconography on dark backgrounds.
- **Ash Slate (#64748b):** Helper text, subtext, and legal copy.
- **Ink Slate (#0f172a):** High-contrast text on light surfaces (used sparingly in light mode).
- **Mist Slate (#e2e8f0):** Light borders and subtle separators in light mode.
- **Soft Paper Gray (#f5f7f8):** Light canvas for light mode contexts.
- **Granite Slate (#475569):** Tertiary text and muted iconography.

## 3. Typography Rules
- **Font Family:** Inter, clean and modern throughout.
- **Hierarchy:** Bold headers (600–700) for primary statements; medium labels (500–600) for form fields; regular body (400–500) for supportive text.
- **Tone:** Tight, readable typography with clear emphasis; no decorative spacing.

## 4. Component Stylings
- **Buttons:** Full-width primary CTAs in electric blue with white text, generously rounded corners, and a subtle glow. Secondary actions are text links in electric blue.
- **Cards/Containers:** Rounded-xl geometry with soft depth; used for icon badges or subtle emphasis elements.
- **Inputs/Forms:** Tall, rounded-xl inputs with muted slate borders and left-aligned labels; focus is highlighted via the electric-blue accent.

## 5. Layout Principles
- **Structure:** Full-screen authentication flows with a centered logo at the top and a single-column form stack.
- **Spacing:** Generous vertical rhythm between elements; comfortable side padding and clear separation between sections.
- **Alignment:** Labels and inputs are left-aligned; secondary links are centered or left-aligned based on emphasis.
- **Density:** Moderate and breathable, favoring clarity over compactness.
